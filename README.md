# Tiktoks Creation Bot 
This is a simple python script (sorry for the messy code, It was just made for fun and testing :)) that takes 4 for inputs :
-the hook first <br/>
-the background video for the hook <br/>
-the content <br/>
-the background video for the hook <br/>
-the background video for the content <br/>
-the background music
And then returns the video in output.mp4

## Required Software :
-Python 3.9.13 <br/>
-ImageMagic <br/>
-FFMPEG (comes w/ImageMgic)

## Required python Packages :
-Numpy <br/>
-MoviePy <br/>
-Requests <br/>
-Nakedpip

## IMPORTANT NOTE:
-All the input videos should have a ratio of 9:16 (720*1080p) and a framerate of 24 fps <br/>
-You need to Downgrade Pillow to 9.5.0 for the software to run smoothly
